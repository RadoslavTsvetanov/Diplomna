Why typesafety is important -> agentic coding


And why all these rypesafe thingies matters? -> well with the rise of agentic coding we are giving more and more code to chatgpt, and anyone of us who has tried it knows that they perform way better with strongly typed languages. 
But we have to ask ourselfs why that is? -> well its because it has more data, the more compile time checks we have, the less runtime errors we have and like that we shorten the "run the code, encounter rutime error, pastw the error to chatgpt or wait for the agent to pick it up"  cycle and improve the accuracy
Also another bebnefit of this typesafety is reducing mental bamdwidth -> we as developers often need to do some kind of tedious linter like checks which leak some of our mental bandwith and why should we concern ourselfs with things like these when we can outsource this to the compiler
